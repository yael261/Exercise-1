## Parameters

I begin by defining my parameters in a way they can easily be changed again for other applications.

```{r}
mu = 10
dispersion = 2
size = 1/dispersion
```

## Sampling

Hundred values are sampled from the negative binomial distribution with n = 100, dispersion =2 and mu = 10.

```{r}
x <- rnbinom(100, size, mu = mu)
```

## Plotting

Two plots are created using hist(). One with the normal linear scale and the other using the log(x+1) scale.

**Linear scale**

```{r}
hist(x)
```

**log(x+1)**

```{r}
hist(log(x+1))
```

## Reporting Results

The mean of the sample is `r mean(x)` and the variance `r mean(x) + (mean(x)^2)*dispersion`.
